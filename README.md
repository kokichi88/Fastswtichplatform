# Fastswtichplatform
- Improve speed when switch between platforms for Unity.

For Mac:
- Make sure you chmod +x fastswitchplatform.

For Window:
- Make sure you set UAC setting to lowest level.

Using:
- Window -> FastSwitchPlatformWindow -> select platform ( I only support PC, IOS and Android) -> Switch. Unity will restart and it will take a little long time for first time run on each platform. Take a cup of tea and wait :).
- Unity will restart each time you change platform.

Bugs:
- Mac only: sometime Unity couldnâ€™t restart automatically, you have to reopen it manually. I will fix it soon.
